# basicwebscraper
A Python web scrapper that uses the libraries Pandas, BS4, and Requests to retrieve and place data into a CSV file. 

This is a great way for beginners to learn how to use Pandas and BS4 for collecting public information on web interfaces.


To use this program on other websites simply change the URL and make sure to rename the classes that appear in the HTML of your
chosen website. 


This code is heavily derived from Qazi from the Clever Programmer. This code's syntax and additional notes have been my contribution 
and evolution of the base code for this Web Scrapper.
